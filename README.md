# Challenge App

## Description
 The challenge app to is to be cloned from this repository, modified, tested locally and then pushed to a public repo and submitted. 

 You must add authentication to the current rails app.  A user should be able to create an account, login, and logout.  A user should also have the choice to authenticate with one social media website using Oauth2.  

 You can choose any authentication gem or write your own.  The design is entirely up to you.  The project must be cloneable and able to run locally on another users local OSX computer.  Any tests, seeded data or migrations should be explained in the README of this cloned project.

 UI is entirely up to you, the application should be easy to use and understand.  We are not looking for an amazing design as we are more concerend with the code structure and working project.  We do prefer twitter bootstrap but this is not a requirement.

## Requirements
  - rails 4.0.0
  - ruby 2.1.1
  - account creation
  - login
  - logout
  - Oauth2 login
